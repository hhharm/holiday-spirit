## 🎄 What is Holiday Spirit?

Holiday Spirit is an interactive question card game. The app presents a grid of numbered question cards that participants can click to reveal question to spark conversations and create memorable moments.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **First Visit**: When you open the app for the first time, you'll see a question input screen
2. **Enter Questions**: Type or paste your icebreaker questions (one per line) into the textarea
3. **Click Proceed**: Save your questions and start the game

Questions are saved to your device only, and you'll have possibility to remove them later.

### Playing the Game

1. **View the Grid**: You'll see a festive grid of numbered question cards against a holiday background
2. **Select a Card**: Ask some one from your group to pick the card number and open it
3. **Read the Question**: A popup appears showing the question in large, easy-to-read text
4. **Choose Your Action**:
   - **Close**: Dismiss the question without marking it as answered (maybe save it for later!)
   - **Done**: Mark the question as answered - the card will turn gray and become disabled

### Managing Your Session

- **Restart Button**: Clears all answered questions, allowing you to start fresh with the same question set
- **Reset Button**: Completely clears all data and returns to the question input screen

### Tips for Best Experience

- Mix light-hearted questions with deeper conversation starters
- Encourage participants to elaborate on their answers
- Use the "Close" option if a question doesn't fit the current mood
- Consider having someone facilitate to ensure everyone gets a chance to participate
